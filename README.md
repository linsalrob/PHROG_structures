# PHROG_structures

Structures for representatives of all the PHROG protein clusters.

These structures were created by Susie Grigson at Flinders University using resources from Flinders University, Pawsey Supercomputer Centre, and NCI Supercomputer Centre. Please contact Susie for appropriate attribution.

Please [see the website](https://linsalrob.github.io/PHROG_structures/) for the interactive version, or download the `gh-pages` branch for the raw data.

Note: you will see we are currently using a version of PyMol with an expired license. We are addressing that issue.
